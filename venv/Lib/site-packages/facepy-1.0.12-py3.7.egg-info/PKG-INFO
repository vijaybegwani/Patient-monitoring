        Usage
        -----
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from facepy import GraphAPI
        
            # Initialize the Graph API with a valid access token (optional,
            # but will allow you to do all sorts of fun stuff).
            graph = GraphAPI(oauth_access_token)
        
            # Get my latest posts
            graph.get('me/posts')
        
            # Post a photo of a parrot
            graph.post(
                path = 'me/photos',
                source = open('parrot.jpg', 'rb')
            )
        
        Facepy can do more than reading your latest posts and posting photographs of parrots, but you'll have to
        `read the documentation <http://facepy.rtfd.org>`_ to find out how.
        
        Please note that Facepy does *not* do authentication with Facebook; it only consumes its API. To get an
        access token to consume the API on behalf of a user, use a suitable OAuth library for your platform (if you're
        using Django, for example, you might use `Fandjango <https://github.com/jgorset/fandjango>`_).

        Johannes Gorset made this. You should `tweet me <http://twitter.com/jgorset>`_ if you can't get it
        to work. In fact, you should tweet me anyway.
        
        I love Schibsted
        ----------------
        
        I work at `Schibsted Products & Technology <https://github.com/schibsted>`_ with a bunch of awesome folks
        who are every bit as passionate about building things as I am. If you're using
        Facepy, we probably want to hire you.
